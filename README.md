# anyps5-lift

A static recompiler for PS5 executables. `ps5lift` lifts guest x86-64 code to LLVM IR and compiles it to native code for the host, so a title can run on aarch64 Linux machines such as the NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10) without an x86 emulator. The system libraries come from [AnyPS5](https://github.com/boykopovar/anyps5), which is a submodule; its ELF reader and `.eh_frame` scanner are the lifter's frontend.

Status: **milestone 2 in progress**. Guest code built for Zen 2, including SSE, AVX2, FMA, F16C and x87 code, lifts and runs on aarch64 with the same output as on x86-64. AnyPS5's PS5-style test executables (NID imports, static TLS) relink, lift and run. Real titles do not run yet; see [the design](docs/DESIGN.md), [known gaps](docs/DEBT.md) and [next steps](docs/NEXT.md).

## Build

Requirements: CMake 3.22+, Ninja, Clang and LLD, LLVM 18 or newer with development files (`llvm-18-dev libzstd-dev zlib1g-dev` on Ubuntu 24.04 / DGX OS), Python 3. The PS5 fixture tests also need GCC (for the AnyPS5 relinker) and the bridge generator needs the libclang Python bindings (`python3-clang-18`).

```sh
git submodule update --init
git -C 3rdparty/zydis submodule update --init
git -C 3rdparty/anyps5 submodule update --init 3rdparty/ZArchive
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib/cmake/llvm
ninja -C build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

When the tests run lifted code natively they lift it for the host CPU (`--cpu native`); the `neoverse-v2` default uses SVE, which CPUs such as Apple's do not have. On an aarch64 host the test lifts the fixture and runs it natively; building the x86-64 guests there needs an x86-64 cross toolchain and libraries (`g++-x86-64-linux-gnu` on Ubuntu). On an x86-64 host it also runs it natively and, when `qemu-aarch64` and an aarch64 sysroot are installed (`qemu-user g++-aarch64-linux-gnu`), lifts it for aarch64 and runs it under qemu. The AnyPS5 submodule points at the `aarch64-host` branch of [szatmary/AnyPS5](https://github.com/szatmary/AnyPS5), which carries the changes that build AnyPS5's libraries for a lifted guest on top of upstream. The libc tests reserve the PS5 user address range, about 1 TiB of address space, so they fail under a `ulimit -v` limit.

`tools/build_runtime.py` builds the runtime and [Berkeley SoftFloat](https://github.com/ucb-bar/berkeley-softfloat-3) (a submodule, for x87) into a static library per target; the tests build and cache it in `build/runtime-<arch>`.

## Use

A PS5 executable goes through the AnyPS5 relinker first, which the test build compiles as `build/anyps5-relinker/core/relinker/relinker`:

```sh
build/anyps5-relinker/core/relinker/relinker eboot.bin eboot.elf
```

```sh
build/lifter/ps5lift eboot.elf -o guest.o --cpu native
python3 tools/build_runtime.py --triple aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --output build/runtime-aarch64
clang++ -O2 -Iruntime/include bridges.cpp guest.o build/runtime-aarch64/libps5lift_runtime.a build/runtime-aarch64/libps5lift_main.a -fuse-ld=lld -pthread -o guest
./guest
```

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--triple` | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | Target for the generated code. |
| `--cpu` | `neoverse-v2` on aarch64 | Target CPU; `native` uses the host CPU and features. |
| `--features` | none | LLVM target features, such as `-rcpc-immo`. |
| `--memory tso\|relaxed` | `tso` | `tso` keeps x86 ordering with acquire loads and release stores; `relaxed` uses plain accesses and is only correct for single-threaded guests. |
| `--float exact\|fast` | `exact` | `exact` reproduces x86 NaN, min/max, DAZ and conversion results bit for bit; `fast` leaves NaN payloads to the host. |
| `--preserve-flags` | off | Keeps the status flags across calls and returns, for hand-written assembly that relies on them. |
| `--import-nids` | off | Imports a plain symbol name as its NID, so a guest built for Linux calls AnyPS5's exports. |
| `--emit-ir file.ll` | none | Writes the optimized LLVM IR. |
| `-O0` | optimized | Skips the LLVM optimization pipeline. |

The lifter prints how many functions and instructions it lifted and lists every unsupported instruction it found. Reaching one at run time stops the program with its address.

## Import bridges

`tools/generate_bridges.py` reads an AnyPS5 library's sources with libclang and writes one bridge per export: a function named after the export's NID that takes the arguments from the guest's SysV registers and stack and calls the native implementation through its C prototype, so the host compiler produces the native call.

```sh
python3 tools/generate_bridges.py libc -o libc_bridges.cpp
```

Function-pointer parameters become native thunks that call back into the guest (see [the design](docs/DESIGN.md#callbacks)), `long double` values cross between the guest's x87 format and the host's, and a variadic export calls its `v` sibling with a SysV `va_list` built from the guest's registers (see [variadic imports](docs/DESIGN.md#variadic-imports)). It prints how many exports it could not bridge and why; `--report` lists them. For libc it writes 1395 bridges and leaves 33 exports: records passed or returned by value (21), complex values (6), function pointers as return values (4) and `setjmp`/`longjmp`, which need the guest's own registers.

Several libraries can go into one file (`generate_bridges.py libc libkernel -o bridges.cpp`); a NID that more than one exports gets the first one's bridge. `tools/survey_libraries.py` compiles every AnyPS5 library for a lifted aarch64 guest and generates its bridges, and reports what fails for each (`--json` keeps the details).

The bridges call AnyPS5's libc built for the lifted guest (`-DANYPS5_GUEST_LIFTED`). `tools/run_libc_tests.py --triple aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` builds it and runs upstream's libc tests against it, and `tools/run_libc_fixture.py` lifts a guest that calls it through the generated bridges; ctest runs both for each target.

## Benchmark

`tools/bench.py` times five memory-heavy kernels (streaming, pointer chasing, struct copies, a hash table and heap sort) built natively, natively without vectorization, and lifted with each memory model, and checks that every build computes the same results:

```sh
python3 tools/bench.py --ps5lift build/lifter/ps5lift
```

`tso/relaxed` is the cost of keeping x86 ordering, `tso/native` the cost of lifting against the same code compiled natively without vectorization. On an x86-64 host the ordering is free and the numbers show the lifting overhead only; the Spark shows both. `--scale` changes the working set (16, the default, uses about 128 MiB).
